<h1>Countess</h1>

Demo application using Bootstrap 4 Alpha and Chart.js

<h2>Getting started</h2>

The demo Web API is written in PHP, so you need a webserver software like Apache to get it running.

To compile and compress the SCSS and JS files I use <a href="http://koala-app.com/">Koala</a>. Koala is an app for web developers and has a GUI. :)
